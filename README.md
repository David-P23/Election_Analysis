# Election_Analysis
The purpose of this election analysis was to present the Election Data in an organized and digestable manner to our client.
To achieve this we will code an algorithm to read the raw election data and present a summary of the results.

## Overview of Audit
The purpose of the audit is to count the votes in each county for each candidate and determine a winner. This saves the
hundreds of hours it would have taken to manually count the votes using the raw data.

## Election-Audit results
The election results are shown below:

As shown, the total amount of votes were 369,711




## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used for any election by adding modifications. One of these modifications could be simply
updating the candidate names for next year's election in the variable that holds that info. the code would then
be able to sort through next election's data. Another modification that could be used is changing the county variables
to city or states to audit an election of a higher or lower magnitude. these modifications would involve changing the 
names within the list of "counties" and changing the output using the text "county" to "state".
